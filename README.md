# Time Series Sales Forecasting
In any organization, there is an embedded desire to predict its future revenue and future sales. The basic recipe followed is “Collect
historical data related to previous sales and use it to predict expected sales”.
Following the same essence, our project entails the sales forecasting for Corporacion Favorita, an Ecuador based grocery retailer.
Grocery retailers deal with large volumes of perishable goods. Hence accurate forecasts of demands and sales are essential to reduce
wastage and manage operating `costs.

Various modelling techniques such as Regression models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and statistical models (Holt winters exponential
smoothing, ARIMA and SARIMAX) were used to predict future sales. After running and predicting using the various models, it was
concluded that different models at different levels of prediction were required for various use cases.

Usecases Covered : Annual Budgets and Plans in Company Review, Supply chain and demand forecasting planning, Resource allocation and cashflow management planning
